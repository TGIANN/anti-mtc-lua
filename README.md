# anti-mtc-lua
I wanted to share how I fixed the lua executor of the trick called MTCheats in 10 minutes. You can use it as you like, I would be grateful if you give credit

# How To Use?
It is extremely simple to use. You will import this file into all your scripts (if you have a little bit of code knowledge, you can also include it into your scripts as automation).

# How Is It Works?
In fact, what the MTC is doing is very simple. It is to hook into the script and run code from the lua runtime. And it's just a simple script function to inspect where the function is coming from.
